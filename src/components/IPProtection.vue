      <h2>Intellectual Property and Copyright Protection with Blockchain</h2>

      You can create proof of existence for your authentic work, e.g. design, musical composition, source code, movie script or anything else that can be considered as intellectual property and falls under copyright protection law.

      As an owner of the work, you can prevent the unauthorized use of your intellectual property. For this, you need to have a proof that you are the author or have the licensing rights to the original work.

      Set in Block allows you to create such proof on the blockchain in an easy way, without the need for third parties or complicated registration procedures. Blockchain based proofs are immutable and incorruptible, and they never expire.

      <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <h4>How can I protect my authentic work using Set in Block?</h4>

      The best practice is to mention the ID of the authentic work in the Set in Block message. The ID is unique to that work and being written on the blockchain, it mathematically proves that the work existed at the time of the Set in Block message creation. You can also mention the authorship, ownership. For more details, see this blog post.
      <br><br>
      Select a file to generate its ID. It will not be uploaded to the internet or the blockchain, only the file ID with meta information will be generated locally. Keep the copy of the original file in your archive.

      When you select a file, Set in Block generates the unique ID (SHA-256 hash) that represents that file. The ID is generated 
      on your local device, the file itself is not being uploaded to the internet, and its contents are not seen by anyone. This unique ID 
      represents your file's integrity. There is no other file in existence that has the same ID.

      You can also include a text message that will be added to the blockchain next to your design's ID.

      The app then allows you to add the ID and the text message (if provided) to the Ethereum transaction on the blockchain and it shows the date when this data 
      was added. This blockchain based information is immutable and incorruptible, and it never expires. By having this information on the 
      blockchain, you have a proof that the design file, represented by the particular ID, existed prior to a specific date and that you are 
      the author of the design. You can then use this proof to legally defend your original work.

      Example: John selects a design file that has the ID 'd4c8a0fe65951c6531017761146d5a716b073e64' and then adds the message '© Jordan Whitfield'. 
      When he adds this design's data to the blockchain, he gets the transaction nr, in this case it is 0x7f78d6890f85639f9d4c66401f6b9e9cb62256266440e146d07a3a8478e8ed90. 
      He can view this transaction on <a href="https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0x7f78d6890f85639f9d4c66401f6b9e9cb62256266440e146d07a3a8478e8ed90" target="_blank">
      Etherscan</a> (or any other Ethereum block explorer). The data of his design was added to the transaction's “Input Data” field, 
      first the desing's file ID and then the message. The message can be viewed when converted to ASCII mode.




      <h4>If Set in Block will shut down or be unreachable, what will happen to my record?</h4>

      Even if Set in Block is not reachable, your blockchain record is never lost. It can be easily viewed and verified 
      directly on the Ethereum blockchain, bypassing Set in Block entirely.
      </p>	
      <p>
      <h4>Can the record expire?</h4>

      The record has no expiration date, it is permanent. Even if Ethereum blockchain stops adding new data, 
      it will still be archived by people and be accessible for as long as you can imagine.
      </p>	
      <p>
      <h4>Can someone change or corrupt my record or can it be lost in any way?</h4>

      The unique quality of the blockchain is that it is immutable and incorruptible, and because of its 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_timestamping#Decentralized_timestamping_on_the_blockchain" target="_blank">decentralized</a> nature, 
      the data you add to the blockchain can never be lost.
      <br><br>
      Theoretically, there is always a chance that an unknown flaw of blockchain will be discovered or that some new 
      technology will make it obsolete, but from the beginning of the blockchain technology (2008), this has never happened,
      even though there were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw8W92iIHZ8" target="_blank">countless attempts</a> 
      to break it one way or another.
      </p>

      <h4>Is a blockchain based proof of fact accepted as legally valid evidence in courts around the globe?</h4>

      Yes, it is. Below is the excerpt from a 2017, Oct 13 
      <a href="http://www.grantthornton.com.mt/insights/blockchain-technology-and-intellectual-property-ownership/" target="_blank">article</a>, 
      published on the Grant Thornton website.
      <br><br>
      "With expert testimony, the purely mathematical strength of a blockchain certificate can be presented in court everywhere. 
      The main concern, however, is that the application is also not yet widespread enough to prescribe legal validation. 
      <br><br>
      Thankfully many countries are already taking the necessary steps, having recognised the convenience of the blockchain as a public registry. 
      Legislators in many countries such as the US, Sweden, Japan, Brazil, UK and Dubai are pushing forward several initiatives to 
      acknowledge evidence and records based on blockchain and distributed ledger technologies. The EU is heading in the same direction, and 
      the current eIDAS regulation (an EU regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the 
      internal market) already prohibits courts from denying the legal admissibility of timestamps as evidence on sole grounds that the 
      timestamp does not meet the more stringent requirements of an EU-qualified timestamp."

      <h4>How can I prove that I am the author of a particular blockchain record?</h4>

      There are two ways how you can do this:
      <br><br>
      1. You can include author's name in the message that you are going to record. The message will be added to the blockchain and can be read by anyone.
      <br><br>
      2. Not to disclose author's name but still have a proof? Possible. You can include the author's name in the hashed file, record its hash on the blockchain and keep the file in your archive. You can ten proof that the file with the author's name existed prior to the record's date.
      </p>	
      <p>
      <h4>How can I defend my design if I see the infringement?</h4>

      Open your protected design's page and generate cease and desist letter. Then email this letter to the person or company which is infringing your
      intellectual property rights. Attach your original design and also screeshots where the infringer is using it without your permission.
      <br><br>
      If the person or company does not collaborate, then send this letter to the authorities, e.g., the hosting provider of the website
      or use the copyright infringement form to contact Facebook, YouTube or any other web platform if the intellectual property infringement is on any of these sites.
      The illegal use of your intellectual property will then be taken down by the authorities.
      </p>	
      <p>
      <h4>What kind of designs can be protected?</h4>

      Any kind of original works that fall under copyrights law can be protected.
      <br><br>
      Apart from copyright protection, you can also protect ideas, sketches, prototypes... Even though ideas, in general, 
      are not eligible for the copyright protection, you can still use a blockchain proof to show that you are the author of the idea. 
      This can be a significant proof, if not on legal, then at least on moral grounds.
      </p>	
      <p>
      <h4>What's the big deal about not disclosing design file's contents?</h4>

      As mentioned earlier, when you select your design file, it is not being uploaded to Protected.design servers or disclosed to anyone 
      in any way. For the visual preview, the design is loaded from your local disk or the external url that you provide. Protected.design
      never stores your data or your files. The only data we store, is your design's ID, your file's size, the message (if provided) and
      Ethereum transaction hash. This data does not reveal your identity in any way (if you do not reveal it in the message) and it
      does not reveal your file's contents.
      <br><br>
      This is important firstly because it allows your design's protection function independently from Protected.design.
      <br><br>
      Secondly, there can be many cases when the owner does not want to disclose the contents of a new and unique design or idea. The 
      non-disclosure is guaranteed by the technology of Protected.design. You can check our source code on <a href="https://github.com/dziungles/protected.design" target="_blank">
      GitHub</a> and see that this is true.
      </p>	
      <p>
      <h4>How is design's ID generated? Is it enough to add to the blockchain only the ID and not the file itself?</h4>

      The ID is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2" target="_blank">SHA-256</a> hash. 
      You can generate this hash independently as SHA-256 is a well known and standardized hashing algorithm.
      <br><br>
      When you hash a file, you get a unique string that represents the integrity of your file. If you change your file even slightly, the 
      hash that represents that file will be completely different. If you can prove that a particular hash existed on a specific date, 
      it means that the design file, represented by that hash, also existed.
      <br><br>
      You can create a similar SHA-256 hash from your file without the need of using Protected.design, e.g., by using this online 
      <a href="https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256_checksum.html" target="_blank">SHA-256 hash generator</a>.
      <br><br>
      To add only the file's hash (ID) is entirely sufficient proof for the design's protection because there is no other file in existence with the same ID. 
      To add the whole file to the blockchain is possible, but that would be highly unpractical. Firstly, because of the privacy
      reasons - the file's contents would be revealed to everyone. Secondly, adding data to the blockchain is highly expensive because
      of the distributed nature of the technology. To add the whole image file to the blockchain would cost thousands of dollars.
      </p>	
      <p>
      <h4>How is the design's visual preview generated?</h4>

      When the user selects a design file from a local device, the file is not uploaded to Protected.design but stored locally in browser's cache 
      and the preview is loaded from this stored file. If the user refreshes the page, the local cache clears, and the preview disappears.
      <br><br>
      When submiting new design for protection, the user can also provide a link to the same file. If the file is in png, jpg, or gif format and is not 
      bigger than 15 MB, it will be automatically loaded in protected design's page. While design's status is 'Waiting for payment', the link can be modified similarly as 
      the message - just submit the same file again, but with a different preview url.
      <br><br>
      If the user removes the file from the url that is provided in Protected.design, then the design's page will load similarly as if there is no preview 
      file url provided.
      <br><br>
      Alternatively, the preview file can be added to the link after the "?" sign. Our back-end PHP script will fetch the file and generate its hash (ID). It then checks it
      against the particular design's ID, and if they match it then sends image file data back to the front-end to render the preview. Even though the file is 
      fetched by our back-end script, it is never saved on the server. All traces of the file on our server disappear as soon as the session ends.
